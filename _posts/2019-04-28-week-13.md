## Team Progress
After dicussing the suggestions made from our current PR's code review, we were able to figure out how to modify our
PR as per their suggestion. My contribution this week to my team was making the actual changes and submitting it for
re-review. I haven't had time to look more into my other issue but I hope to continue looking this week.
