# Creating Mood, Our Firefox Extension
I've always thought of extensions as double edge swords. They have a lot of power over a user and depending on the functionality, it can be easy to develop. On the other side, developing an extension also depends on any SDK you may be using and can get complicated to debug. That is why I was comfortable with having a simple functioning extension.

While developing Mood, we ran into a couple problems with wiring our jQuery and Javascript to the extension. At first, it was unable to load our HTML because we were using a function that would be called whenever a tab was open. That being said, our extension was opening up every time a link was clicked. My team and I didn't have any in-depth conversation about how to wire our extension together, but we were able to find alternative ways to resolve this bug by using another function in the manifest of the extension, and loading the Javascript with the HTML instead.

The bright side is that my team has been submitting Pull Request and branching out from the repo so that we don't have any conflicts. We haven't had any major Git problems, and we mostly communicate over messages or through out GitHub commits and PRs.
