## Flutter's License
Last week, I reviewed Flutter as an open source project. It is copyrighted by the Chromium Authors since Flutter is one of Google's creations.
The license basically only has three conditions in the redistribution of the source code. These three conditions makes sure that
anyone using the source will not use Google Inc. to promote other software without permission. It must also be reproduced with the same copyright notice.

Here's a link to Flutter's [license](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Working on an OSS
Since I'm not familiar with Dart, I decided not to look into Flutter. Instead, I chose [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) as my OSS.
The installation of Gatsby was very easy. I didn't encounter any errors and was able to figure out how to deploy my own Gatsby server.
Luckily, Gatsby has a issue label called "good first issue" that seems to be a good place to start. Will look into one of these issues to start with this week.
